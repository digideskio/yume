Mana:
  - Required to build towers
  - Required to cast spells
  - Slowly regenerates
  - Can be recovered with Mana Potions
  - Killing a monster regenerates more mana
  - Certain towers are influenced by this stat
  - How to increase maximum Mana?

Adrenaline:
  - Increased when enemies reach your base
  - When adrenaline goes over the maximum, the player wakes up
    and the dream is over
  - Can be lowered with Pain Killers or increased with Adrenaline Pills
  - Increases efficiency of certain towers
  - Spells become more focused
  - Slowly restored towards baseline
  - The baseline is increased when building towers, to limit the number of
    towers you can build
  - Other things that raise adrenaline temporarily?

a tower that always shoots in every direction, but the range in a
particular direction is dependent on the number of monsters in that
direction

an upgrade key: hold it and click on something to upgrade it.
an focused fire key: all towers (who can) will shoot in that direction when the
key is pressed.

Each tower has a level.  When killing a monster, it gains experience.

global upgrades (techs) and local upgrades.  local ones "raise" the level of
the turret and can also be obtained by killing enough monsters.  local upgrades
should NEVER be bad, so they should increase something like damage.  global
upgrades can be bad depending on the players strategy.

Monsters randomly drop powerups when die

Monsters mutate to counter the players strategy
