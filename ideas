Mana:
  - Required to build towers
  - Required to cast spells
  - Slowly regenerates
  - Can be recovered with Mana Potions
  - Killing a monster regenerates more mana
  - Certain towers are influenced by this stat
  - How to increase maximum Mana?

Adrenaline:
  - Increased when enemies reach your base
  - When adrenaline goes over the maximum, the player wakes up
    and the dream is over
  - Building stuff raises your adrenaline
  - Can be lowered with Sedatives or increased with Adrenaline Pills
  - Increases efficiency of certain towers
  - Spells become more focused
  - Slowly restored towards baseline
  - Game runs more slowly with higher adrenaline?
  - Other things that raise adrenaline temporarily?

  Discarded idea:
  - The baseline is increased when building towers, to limit the number of
    towers you can build

instead of sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2) < r use abs(x-a) < r and abs(y-b) < r
for projectile hit testing

instead of mazing with blocking towers, you have to build a "tunnel" through
which monsters have to go

a tower that always shoots in every direction, but the range in a
particular direction is dependent on the number of monsters in that
direction

an upgrade key: hold it and click on something to upgrade it.
an focused fire key: all towers (who can) will shoot in that direction when the
key is pressed.

Each tower has a level.  When killing a monster, it gains experience.

global upgrades (techs) and local upgrades.  local ones "raise" the level of
the turret and can also be obtained by killing enough monsters.  local upgrades
should NEVER be bad, so they should increase something like damage.  global
upgrades can be bad depending on the players strategy.

Shield-monsters which do not cause life loss when they come through but instead
distract the towers by eating bullets.  Certain towers can shoot through them.

Monsters randomly drop powerups when die

Monsters mutate to counter the players strategy

Monsters turn certain kind of damage into power

Towers:
- Bubbles:
    o Shoots high speed projectiles at random enemies
    + Attacks faster if more enemies are in range
    + At a certain chance it can shoot salves of bullets
    - overheats and explodes when they are too active
- Spider:
    + Shoots multiple beams that stay on one enemy
    + Attacks slow enemies down
    o High Adrenaline makes them switch targets
- Lazor:
    + Shoots one beam on varying enemies
    o The beam doesn't jump, the tower has to turn to change targets
    o Shoots through enemies and through shields
    + Synergy with Crystal Ball
    + Synergy with Molecules
- UFO:
    + Shoots one beam that stays on one enemy
    + Beam grows stronger with time
    + Beam causes an explosion when target is switched
    + Drag & Droppable
    + Synergy with other UFO's 
- Virus Tower:
    + Shoots high speed projectiles
    + Poison enemies
    + Poisoned enemies will not recover HP
    o Maybe some evolutionary aspects?
- Crystal Ball:
    o Has a radius of action rather than a projectile
    + Higher Radius when the player has more mana
    + Enemies in the radius are slowed down
    + Towers in the radius recevie less damage
    + Synergy with Lazors:  When they shoot the crystal ball, their
      light is split up into multiple wavelengths for spread damage
- Guardian/Mechanical Tower:
    + Shoots slow projectiles at particular enemies
    + Gains power when it doesn't shoot
    - Powerful projectiles will have a long aftercast delay
- Molecule:
    - Does not attack normally
    + Floats around
    + Synergy with Lazors: They shoot at molecules, building up
      their energy level until a high energy light beam is released
    + Can be moved with the Air spell
- Disruptor:
    o Shoots at random monsters
    + Successful hits will pause monsters for a short time
    - Reduces efficiency of nearby towers
- A sniper tower
- Brain:
    o Lose a life (increase adrenaline baseline) when monster reach the brain
    o Requires 2x2 cells
- Node:
    o Monsters have to walk through this node to get to the brain
- Sticky Node?:
    + Same as node, but monsters are slower here

Spells:
- Fire: Damages towers and enemies in a given radius
- Water: Slows enemies down
- Air: Pushes flying enemies or towers away
- Earth: Heals towers

Items:
- Adrenaline Pills:
    Duration: 2 Minutes
    o Fills Adrenaline Bar, so if a single monster gets through, you wake up
    + After the effect wore off, lower Adrenaline to zero
    - This item sounds rather pointless since towers now cost adrenaline
- Mana Potions:
    Duratoin: 2 minutes
    + Quadruples Mana Regeneration
    + Halves the Mana spent on spells
- Sedative:
    Duration: 1 minute
    o Doubles Adrenaline reuptake
    + Reduces impact of Monsters on Adrenaline
    - Halves Mana regeneration
