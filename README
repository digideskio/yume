Yume is a weird tower defense game that is set in a dream.
It uses adrenaline and mana instead of health points and money,
the monsters are generated with genetic algorithms, and I'm sure
there are other cool features which I have forgotten.

It's also unfinished.

Requires python ~2.7 with numpy and pygame.
